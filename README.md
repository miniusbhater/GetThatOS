## Project updates

[07/01/2026] I am not too sure what i want to do with GetThatOS anymore, i dont really have much interest in continuing development. A full console release may come or at best a winforms release.

[03/01/2026] Sorry for the long wait but i am now completely remaking GetThatOS for like the 5th time but now in wpf so hopefully it looks half decent. I do not have a release timeframe so assume it will be in the coming weeks if i dont loose interest like i usually do, to be safe give me until jan 3rd 2027 it will probably be out by then.

[02/07/2025] I am nearly ready to release the Linux CLI version along with more general updates.

[29/06/2025] After delays the first CLI version is out along with a macOS release.

[11/02/2025] I am now working on a Linux and MacOS CLI version of GetThatOS! There will also be a windows CLI version available but the original winforms version will stay.




## FAQ

#### •How do i know these disk images have not been tampered with?

To put it straight, you don't. BUT all these images are straight from their original website and have not been touched. I would also like to take this opportunity to say please don't download disk images from random shady websites. You don't know what is in those images and it's best not to download them and find out.




#### •Where is *your favourite os*?

I cannot add every single OS ever to exit. If there is one that you desperately need added for whatever reason then find some way to reach out to me and i might just add it for you. I will not be providing ways to reach out, you may find a way by yourself.




#### What if an image does not work?

All images have been tested by me in VMware to ensure that they work exept for a couple that i tested in parallels desktop. But if an image does not work please create an issue and i will fix it ASAP.
