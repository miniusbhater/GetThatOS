## FAQ

#### •Will there ever be a Linux and/or MacOS release?

There might but keep in mind that i am prioritizing Windows even though i am a Linux user, as the majority of OS market share is held by windows, meaning most users will be windows users. But yes there will probably be one in the near future




#### •How do i know these disk images have not been tampered with?

To put it straight, you don't. BUT all these images are straight from their original website and have not been touched. I would also like to take this opportunity to say please don't download disk images from random shady websites. You don't know what is in those images and it's best not to download them and find out.




#### •Where is *your favourite os*?

I cannot add every single OS ever to exit. If there is one that you desperately need added for whatever reason then find some way to reach out to me and i might just add it for you. I will not be providing ways to reach out, you may find a way by yourself.
